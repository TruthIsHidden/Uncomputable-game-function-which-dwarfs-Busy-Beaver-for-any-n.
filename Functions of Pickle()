Let G(n) defined as the growth of the upper n and lower n, such that:
G(n) = Pickle(n+1)/Pickle(n).

Assumption, G(n) > Pickle(n):
If G(n) <= Pickle(n), then Pickle(n+1) ~ Pickle(n)^2 or Pickle(n) * k, such that k < Pickle(n).
Contradiction! The above statement cannot be true as the growth of Pickle(n+1) with respect to Pickle(n) is NOT linear or exponential.
Therefore G(n) >> Pickle(n).

Let R(n) be defined as G(n)^-1.
As n approaches infinity, the limit is 0.
Therefore the growth is incomprehensible.

Let G` be the growth rate of G(n) and G`` be the growth of G`(n).
Thus, we can produce more unbelievably growth (for now only this much later ill do further stuff).

Let C(n) be the ratio of the growth rate of G(n) to Pickle(n).

(Dint use claude for this, thats why the dip in formatting is prolly badd)
