Let G(n) defined as the growth of the upper n and lower n, such that:
G(n) = Pickle(n+1)/Pickle(n).

Assumption, G(n) > Pickle(n):
If G(n) <= Pickle(n), then Pickle(n+1) ~ Pickle(n)^2 or Pickle(n) * k, such that k < Pickle(n).
Contradiction! The above statement cannot be true as the growth of Pickle(n+1) with respect to Pickle(n) is NOT linear or exponential.
Therefore G(n) >> Pickle(n).

Let R(n) be defined as G(n)^-1.
As G(n+1) > G(n), each successive tier grows unbelievably compared to the previous. Therefore As n approaches infinity, the limit is 0.
Therefore the growth is incomprehensible.

Let G` be the growth rate of G(n) and G`` be the growth of G`(n).
Thus, we can produce more unbelievably growth (for now only this much later ill do further stuff).

Let C(n) be the ratio of the growth rate of G(n) to Pickle(n).
Assumption C(n) > Pickle(n):
If Pickle(n) > C(n), then G(n)/Pickle(n),
Pickle(n)^2 > G(n)
Pickle(n)^2 > Pickle(n+1)/Pickle(n)
Pickle(n)^3 > Pickle(n+1)
Contradiction! The above statement is untrue as the growth is NON exponentional.
Therfore C(n) > Pickle(n).

Let G(k,m) be the  M'th growth of Pickle(k). Therefore G(2,0) is -> Growth rate of Pickle(2) or simply G(2).
Therfore G(k,0) = G(k) [Both are represented using G(), but the number of parameters distinguishes]
G(n,n) =  ΔG(n), also known as the diagonal Growth function.
Assumption, G(k+1,m) > G(k,m+1):
G(k, m+1) = G(k+1,m)/G(k,m) - (i)
from (i), G(k+1,m) = G(k,m+1) * G(k,m) - (ii)
substituing (i) and (ii)

G(k,m+1) * G(k,m) >= G(k, m+1)
G(k,m) >= 1
Assume, G(k,m) <= 1.
If m = 0
G(k) <= 1
Pickle(k+1)/Pickle(k) <= 1
Pickle(k+1) <= Pickle(k)
Contradiction! The growth is NOT sub linear.
If m = 1
G(k+1, 0) / G(k, 0) <= 1
G(k+1, 0) <= G(k, 0)
Pickle(K+2)/Pickle(k+1) <= Pickle(k+1)/Pickle(k)
Pickle(k+2) * Pickle(k) <= Pickle(k+1)^2
Since Pickle(k+2) > Pickle(k+1), such that Pickle(k+2) > Pickle(k+1)^2, otherwise the growth would be exponentional, which it isnt.
Contradiction! Pickle(k+2) * Pickle(k) > Pickle(k+1)^2
if m > 1
We prove the same thing as we get the Growth will be decreasing, which it isnt. therefore its a contradiction.

Therefore G(k+1,m) > G(k, m+1)

Growth Tier:
Pickle(n) < C(n) < G(n) < G`(n)...

Computability:
All the above are uncomputable as they are ratio's of uncomputable functions.

(Dint use claude for this, thats why the dip in formatting is prolly badd)
